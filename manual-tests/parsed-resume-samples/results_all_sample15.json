        "value": "Archipelo collects SDLC data. My work as Data Engineer was to provide an alternative to a complex Streaming Graph where data products are constructued in real time to provide actionable data to several application users. The Streaming Graph is based on Dataflow, running Apache Beam as a Streaming system. We process different sources of information and combine them together to create new actionable data products necessary to a set of business use cases. I managed the slicing of this complex streaming graph into small sized, simpliÔ¨Åed `horizontals of processing` different data to different dimensions of the information collected and managed by the product. A key part of my work is to allow our database to be really fast on writes, as we had data consistency issues while using a Postgres Sink to write produced data products. This forced us to use every capability of the Postgres technology available to cope with our needs.

        "value": "Technical Architecture, Cloud Engineering and Data Engineering for the Twist platform.KA From one side, my work is to focus on the data engineering processes to integrate variegate customer data into our propietary data model. We‚Äôve created the whole system from scratch, it is versionable, multi-cloud datalake ecosystem where the major provider is GoogleCloud. Data transformations are run through the execution of workflows to carry out inter-dependent operations, provide consistent logging of actions and able of providing status updates at every step within the workflow. The orchestration runs complex sql queries (T), chained ETL/ELTs, daily imports, etc. into scalable units of processing, as the lowest cost per Gb solution available. The system is already hosting customers in production, is highly maintainable and allows the data science team to update the queries in production under certain I/O conÔ¨Åguration constraints. From the other, an important part of my work is to talk to our customers to design custom AdHoc solutions in order to integrate their data with our system. Along the process, we design the best solution according to the customer needs to Ô¨Åt time and technological constraints into a particular case. From there, our customer is able of leveraging our data model with his own business data.

Cloud Native systems make the data engineering solution design challenging, as resource consuming processes, which most computing processes are, must coexist with production grade services, therefore they must be optimized and well planned. The Solution stands as the main data ecosystem architecture, design of workflows and process deÔ¨Ånitions. Operating thorough a set of Kubernetes clusters where product and infrastructure management solutions are hosted. In order to enable new information flows, I was working on some components on top of K8s to monitor admin actions from 100K+ websites, basically to orchestrate data transformations. Later, we created the Cdn product, we started having more critical perfromance and the existing solution proven deÔ¨Åcient sizing for loads. We designed a new data and compute cloud where to place all data related workflows and processes. Among the tools we used there are Elasticsearch for short term access log storage, Confluent Kafka Streaming, transformations with Spark streaming, s3 object storage (in-house), several scheduler stacks, PrestoSQL for distributed processing among others.

The project is for a Network Analysis company centered on solutions for Network service providers. Involved in a high performance syslog monitoring project, in a High Quality Software environment. The project is a microservice oriented architecture with Golang, Scala and Python as core technologies. I've designed and developed solutions for Golang microservices, worked with Apache Flink for message processing and created development environments based on Skaffold for fast Kubernetes deployment. My main achievement is to provide an architecture on Elasticsearch to store unforeseen amounts of data in a large scale cluster, while keeping Elasticsearch performance at an optimal level in every stage of the project evolution. Prepare an ecosystem for transparent Elasticsearch management in a production system, with seamless operations with no interruption for the ingestion and presentation pipelines while guiding the development to have robust insights of data, shaping the Ô¨Ånal product and triggering the start of few projects inside the company. On the microservice architecture, I made the design of the microservice components directly interacting with the Elasticsearch cluster, both write and read services, and overlook their development from other colleagues.

As a result, many bottlenecks and risk areas present in the system execution where removed, the big process was sliced into smaller independent sub processes.
