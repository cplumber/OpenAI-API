You are a precise resume parser.

Read the entire resume text and output ONLY valid JSON for **two sections**: "contact" and "about". Do not include any other keys. Do not include explanations or Markdown.

### Output schema (must match exactly)
{
  "contact": {
    "name": {"value": "", "m": 0},
    "email": {"value": "", "m": 0},
    "phone": {"value": "", "m": 0},
    "location": {"value": "", "m": 0},
    "linkedin_link": {"value": "", "m": 0},
    "portfolio_link": [
      {"value": "", "m": 0}
    ],
    "messaging": [
      { "platform": "", "value": "", "m": 0 }
    ]
  },
  "about": {
    "description": {"value": "", "m": 0},
    "languages": [
      {
        "language": {"value": "", "m": 0},
        "level": {"value": "", "m": 0}
      }
    ]
  }
}

### Matching rules
- Always output **valid JSON only** (no comments, no trailing commas).
- Every field/object shown above **must be present** in the output.
- Every field has an "m" flag:
  - If **m = 0** → the "value" must be a concrete value copied or precisely normalized from the resume text, OR inferred from explicit hints.
  - If **m = 1** → the "value" must be "" (empty string). Additionally, include either:
    - `"suggestions": [ { "candidate": "", "confidence": 0.000, "source": "text|inferred", "evidence": [ { "span": "" } ] } ]`
    - OR, if there is no real textual hint:  
      `"no_suggestion_reason": "no in-document hints" | "ambiguous evidence", "suggestions": []`
- Arrays must always be present. If empty, use `[]`.
- about.description: copy the dedicated About/Summary text if present; if it is missing or trivial (<15 words, generic self-statement), set m=1 with "no_suggestion_reason":"no in-document hints".

### Contact field rules (minimal)
- contact.linkedin_link: must be a full LinkedIn profile URL (`https://www.linkedin.com/in/...`) or empty if none.  
  • Do not output just "LinkedIn" or partial words.  
  • If only "LinkedIn" is mentioned without a URL/username, set m=1 with `"no_suggestion_reason":"no in-document hints"`.
- contact.portfolio_link: only websites (http/https URLs or bare domains). Exclude usernames/handles.
- contact.messaging: usernames/handles or messaging-app links. Normalize to a single item per platform.
  - Telegram detection (anchor, not exhaustive): `@[\w_]{3,}` when labeled “Telegram”; or `https?://t\.me/[\w_]+` or `telegram:`/`tg:`.
  - Telegram normalization: store as `"platform":"Telegram", "value":"@username"` (strip `https://t.me/` if present).
- Collision rule: if a value matches messaging patterns, do not place it in `portfolio_link`.

### CEFR list
- `level.value` must be exactly one of: [NATIVE, C2, C1, B2, B1, A2, A1].
- If no exact CEFR token is in the text, you must still assign one value by inference from resume evidence (education, career, countries lived/worked). Do not leave `level.value` empty.

- Location inference (must be corroborated):
  • Do **not** infer NATIVE solely from `contacts.location`.  
  • Location may be used as supporting evidence **only if** the same language is also implied in other sections (about, education, projects, experience, certifications).  
  • Example (anchor, not exhaustive): If resume shows university in Spain **and** location = Madrid → Spanish = C2/NATIVE.  
  • If location is bilingual and corroborated, create an additional `about.languages` item for the secondary language:
    - `language.value` = "<secondary language>", `language.m` = 0 (inferred; allowed)
    - `level.value` = "", `level.m` = 1 with a single suggestion:  
      `{ "candidate": "<CEFR>", "confidence": 0.600, "source": "inferred", "evidence": [{"span":"<the location token from text>"}] }`

- Inference ceiling:
  • Resume written in a language without corroborating location/education/work evidence → max C1.  
  • C2 only when text shows higher-education or long-term work/residency in that language’s country/region.  
  • NATIVE only when text states “native/mother tongue” **or** when education/work history clearly ties to that country/region.

- Examples (anchor, not exhaustive):
  - "Basic reading: Polish" → A1  
  - "Worked 6 years in Ukraine" → Ukrainian = NATIVE  
  - "MSc in UK, professional projects in English" → English = C2
