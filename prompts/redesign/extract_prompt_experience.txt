### Output schema (must match exactly)
{
  "experience": [
    {
      "job_title": {"value": "", "m": 0},
      "company": {"value": "", "m": 0},
      "location": {"value": "", "m": 0},
      "start_date": {"value": "", "m": 0},
      "end_date": {"value": "", "m": 0},
      "current": {"value": false, "m": 0},
      "description": {"value": "", "m": 0}
    }
  ]
}

### Field-specific rules
- job_title: take the title exactly as written (anchors: "Software Engineer", "Production Manager / CTO" — not exhaustive). Normalize spacing and case.
- company: copy the full company string (anchors: "Google", "Luxoft", "WEB Recruiters" — not exhaustive). Do not split multiple entities separated by commas; copy as written.
- location: copy location string exactly as written (anchors: "Ukraine (Remote)", "Berlin, Germany" — not exhaustive).
- start_date / end_date: normalize to "MM/YYYY" format if possible. If only year given, output "YYYY". If no end_date and role marked as current, set end_date="" and current.value=true.
- current: true if text says "Present", "Currently", "I currently work here"; otherwise false.
- description: copy the full description of responsibilities/achievements for that role. Preserve commas/semicolons. Do not shorten or fabricate. If description is missing, set m=1 with no_suggestion_reason.

### Ordering
- Output experience items in **reverse chronological order** (most recent job first).
- If multiple roles overlap, preserve the order as written in the resume.
